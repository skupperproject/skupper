# 1. Architectural Decision Records

Date: 2022-03-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architecture decision records in order to have information about important 
changes made in the project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as long it provides value to the project.

## Consequences

Each record will include a single decision.

It is recommended to use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to document these decisions.
