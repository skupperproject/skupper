            Permission to redeem access tokens for links to the local site.
            A remote site can use a token containing the grant URL and secret
            code to obtain a certificate signed by the grant's certificate authority (CA),
            within a certain expiration window and for a limited number of redemptions.

            The code, url, and ca properties of the resource status are used to generate access tokens from the grant.
