            A connector binds a local workload to listeners in remote sites. Listeners
            and connectors are matched by routing key.

            On Kubernetes, a Connector resource has a selector and port for specifying
            workload pods.

            On Docker, Podman, and Linux, a Connector resource has a host and port for
            specifying a local server. Optionally, Kubernetes can also use a host and port.

                  description: |-
                    The identifier used to route traffic from listeners to connectors.
                    To expose a local workload to a remote site, the remote listener and
                    the local connector must have matching routing keys.
                  type: string
                port:

                selector:
                  description: |-
                    A Kubernetes label selector for specifying target server pods. It uses
                    <label-name>=<label-value> syntax.

                    On Kubernetes, either selector or host is required.
                  type: string
                host:
                  description: |-
                    The hostname or IP address of the server. This is an alternative to
                    selector for specifying the target server.

                    On Kubernetes, either selector or host is required.

                    On Docker, Podman, or Linux, host is required.

                    The name of a bundle of TLS certificates used for secure router-to-server
                    communication. The bundle contains the trusted server certificate
                    (usually a CA). It optionally includes a client certificate and key for
                    mutual TLS.

                    On Kubernetes, the value is the name of a Secret in the current namespace.
                    On Docker, Podman, and Linux, the value is the name of a directory under
                    input/certs/ in the current namespace.
