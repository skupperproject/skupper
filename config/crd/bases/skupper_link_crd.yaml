            A link is a channel for communication between sites.
            Links carry application connections and requests.  A set of linked
            sites constitutes a network.

            A Link resource specifies remote connection endpoints and TLS
            credentials for establishing a mutual TLS connection to a remote
            site.  To create an active link, the remote site must first enable
            _link access_.  Link access provides an external access point for
            accepting links.

            **Note:** Links are not usually created directly.  Instead, you can
            use an AccessToken to obtain a link.

                  description: |-
                    The name of a bundle of certificates used for mutual TLS
                    router-to-router communication.  The bundle contains the
                    client certificate and key and the trusted server certificate
                    (usually a CA).

                    On Kubernetes, the value is the name of a Secret in the
                    current namespace.

                    On Docker, Podman, and Linux, the value is the name of a
                    directory under `input/certs/` in the current namespace.

                    A map containing additional settings.  Each map entry has a
                    string name and a string value.

                    **Note:** In general, we recommend not changing `settings` from
                    their default values.
