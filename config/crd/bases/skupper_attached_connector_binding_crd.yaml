            An attached connector binding is a binding to an attached connector in a peer namespace that allows you to 
            bring a workload into your existing VAN without creating a separate site or establishing inter-site links.
            The name of this resource must be the same as that of the associated AttachedConnector resource in the peer 
            namespace.

                    The identifier used to route traffic from listeners to connectors. To expose a local workload to a 
                    remote site, the remote listener and the local connector must have matching routing keys.
