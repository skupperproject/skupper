            An attached connector is a connector in a peer namespace that allows you to bring a workload into your existing VAN without creating a separate site or establishing inter-site links.
            The name of this resource must be the same as that of the associated AttachedConnectorBinding resource in the site namespace.

                    A Kubernetes label selector for specifying target server pods. It uses <label-name>=<label-value> syntax.
                    On Kubernetes, either selector or host is required.

                    Advanced. The name of a bundle of TLS certificates used for secure router-to-server communication. The bundle contains the trusted server certificate (usually a CA). It optionally includes a client certificate and key for mutual TLS.
                    On Kubernetes, the value is the name of a Secret in the current namespace. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, the value is the name of a directory under input/certs/ in the current namespace.
