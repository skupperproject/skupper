# This make file provides three operations:
#
# - Copy a list of images (hardcoded below) to a main repository (by default,
#   quay.io/skupper), possibly modifying and reassembling them
# - Generate and push images to that same repository, based on Containerfiles
# - Copy both lists of images above (external and generated) to another,
#   configurable repository
#
# See the README.md for the rationale of each of them.
#
# The basic operation is to copy or generate-and-push a single image into
# the MAIN_REPO:
#
#   make docker.io/svagi/nghttp2
#   make docker.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged
#   make nghttp2
#
# The possible values are those listed on EXTERNAL_IMAGES, REASSEMBLE_IMAGES
# and GENERATED_IMAGES.
#
# You can also only build an image (and not push it).  Just add _build to the
# image name listed in GENERATED_IMAGES:
#
#   make nghttp2_build
#
# Alternativelly, one can build/push or copy all generated, all external, all
# reassembled, or all of them:
#
#   make external_images
#   make reassembled_images
#   make generated_images
#   make everything
#
# Notice that the Makefile itself will not check whether the copy or build/push
# is necessary; the underlying tools (podman and skopeo) may do that, but they
# may still consume Dockerhub pull requests in the process.
#
# As with any Makefile, you can configure the execution by setting variables
# on the make invocation:
#
#   make MAIN_REPO=quay.io/dhashimo docker.io/ssorj/quiver
#
# The command above will copy docker.io/ssorj/quiver into the quay repository
# quay.io/dhashimo, instead of the default MAIN_REPO
#
#   make MAIN_REPO=quay.io/dhashimo everything
#
# Similarly, the command above will copy and build/generate everything, but
# into the specified MAIN_REPO.
#
# The last operation is to copy images from MAIN_REPO to another repository,
# which needs to be specified.
#
#   make COPY_REPO=192.168.0.1:5000/internal copy
#
# The command above will copy all images (external and generated, as listed
# below) from the MAIN_REPO into the 'internal' repository within the
# registry running at 192.168.0.1:5000.
#
# Individual items can also be specified.  For that, just add '_copy' to
# their main target names:
#
#   make COPY_REPO=192.168.0.1:5000/internal nghttp2_copy
#   make COPY_REPO=192.168.0.1:5000/internal docker.io/ssorj/quiver_copy
#   make COPY_REPO=192.168.0.1:5000/internal docker.io/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged_copy
#
# This Makefile is intended to be executed manually, with the login of
# individual users, and not by a robot account on a CI.
#
# ATTENTION: Remember that images copied for the first time into quay may
#            be created as 'private' images, and need to be changed into
#            'public' before they can be used by CI and other users.
