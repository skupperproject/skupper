# Skupper

Skupper enables cloud communication by enabling you to create a Virtual Application Network.

This application layer network decouples addressing from the underlying network infrastructure.
This enables secure communication without a VPN.

You can use Skupper to create a network from namespaces in one or more Kubernetes clusters as described in the [Getting Started](https://skupper.io/start/index.html).
This guide describes a simple network, however there are no restrictions on the topology created which can include redundant paths.

Connecting one Skupper site to another site enables communication both ways.
Communication can occur using any path available on the network, that is, direct connections are not required to enable communication.

Skupper supports [anycast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) and [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast) communication using the application layer network (VAN), allowing you to configure your topology to match business requirements.

Skupper does not require any special privileges, that is, you do not require the `cluster-admin` role to create networks.
